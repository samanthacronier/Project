# This script does the following:
#   Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#   Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
#   Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#   Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
#   From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
#   of each variable for each activity and each subject.
