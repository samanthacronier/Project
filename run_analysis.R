# This script does the following:
#   1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#   2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
#   3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#   4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
#   5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
#       of each variable for each activity and each subject.
